# 🛡️ Red Team Journey by walker89

Welcome to my cybersecurity journey! I'm transitioning from a career in heavy equipment and logistics into the world of offensive security, red teaming, and security research.

This repository will contain:
- Python & Bash tools I build while learning
- Write-ups of TryHackMe and CTF labs
- Notes on cloud and machine learning security
- Reflections on how game development and AI overlap with hacking
